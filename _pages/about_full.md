I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at London Business School. My research explores the impact of institutional investors on asset prices and borrowing fees, retail trading in options, and frictions in ETF and options markets. I have published in the Journal of Finance and the Review of Financial Studies, and my work has been cited in international media, including Bloomberg and The Economist. Prior to starting my PhD at London Business School, I worked in asset management in Switzerland and the UK.

Research interests: Asset Pricing, Asset Management, Limits to Arbitrage, Options.

I will be on the 2023/2024 academic job market.

## Job Market Paper

**<a href="" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Institutional Investors, Securities Lending, and Short-Selling Constraints</a>**

Institutional ownership is thought to facilitate short-selling. Indeed, short sellers typically borrow from the holdings of institutions. Yet, institutional demand, and hence lending supply, is endogenous. This paper isolates changes in this demand due to investment mandates (benchmark indexes) to shed new light on the role of institutions in lending markets. In a model with benchmarked fund managers who supply their risky holdings for lending, the equilibrium price and lending supply are both higher for the benchmark asset. Larger supply alleviates short-selling constraints while higher shorting demand (due to inflated price) exacerbates them. Two quasi-natural experiments, the Russell index reconstitution and the Bank of Japan purchases, confirm that stocks with more institutional capital benchmarked against them have larger lending supply and demand. Ultimately, they are costlier to short. In both theory and data, results are driven by incomplete pass-through from institutional holdings to lending supply.

<summary> <strong>Abstract and more</strong> </summary>

We document a rapid increase in retail trading in options in the U.S.  Facilitated by payment for order flow (PFOF) from wholesalers executing retail orders, retail trading recently reached over 60% of the total market volume. Nearly 90% of PFOF comes from three wholesalers. Exploiting new flags in transaction-level data, we isolate wholesaler trades and build a novel measure of retail options trading. Our measure comoves with equity-based retail activity proxies and drops significantly during U.S. brokerage platform outages and trading restrictions. Retail investors prefer cheaper, weekly options, with the average bid-ask spread of a whopping 12.6%, and lose money on average.

Benchmarking incentivizes fund managers to invest a fraction of their funds’ assets in their benchmark indices, and such demand is inelastic. We construct a measure of inelastic demand a stock attracts, benchmarking intensity (BMI), computed as its cumulative weight in all benchmarks, weighted by assets following each benchmark. Exploiting the Russell 1000/2000 cutoff, we show that changes in stocks’ BMIs instrument for changes in ownership of benchmarked investors. The resulting demand elasticities are low. We document that both active and passive fund managers buy additions to their benchmarks and sell deletions. Finally, an increase in BMI lowers future stock returns.

<summary> <strong>Abstract and more</strong> </summary>

The recent retail trading boom in the U.S. options market, driven by an inflow of inexperienced investors, coincides with an increase in call option contracts left suboptimally unexercised.  Arbitrageurs exploit these investor mistakes via so-called dividend play trades, which produce (virtually) riskless profits.  Using transaction-level data and a new reporting requirement, we identify dividend play trades and document rising profits from this strategy.  Puzzlingly, however, arbitrageurs leave 50% of potential profits on the table. Few arbitrageurs exploit each contract, with a median of only one. Finally, our paper details how market participants circumvent a regulation devised to curtail dividend play.

**<a href="http://staisiya.github.io/files/Gorbatikov_and_Sikorskaya_2022.pdf" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Two APs Are Better Than One: ETF Mispricing and Primary Market Participation</a>** (with E. Gorbatikov).

<details>
<summary> <strong>Abstract and more</strong> </summary>

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) depend on arbitrageurs to correct deviations between a fund's price and its fair value. ETFs have designated brokers, or authorized participants (APs), who have a unique right to create and redeem ETF shares, and who can thus trade on ETF mispricing without risk. Using novel regulatory filings, we provide the first description of the US ETF-AP network. It has a dense core and a sparse periphery, and the observed creation/redemption volumes are highly concentrated. The level of mispricing in a US equity ETF is negatively related to the fund's primary market diversity, especially during times of high market volatility. Funds that share more APs exhibit stronger mispricing comovement. We theoretically show that diverse primary markets help mitigate the effect of shocks to AP-specific arbitrage costs. We highlight the importance of AP balance sheet usage costs in ETF markets by exploiting the Federal Reserve's purchases of bond ETFs in 2020.
