**<a href="http://staisiya.github.io/files/Sikorskaya_JMP_2023.pdf" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">Institutional Investors, Securities Lending, and Short-Selling Constraints</a>**

Institutional ownership is thought to facilitate short-selling, as short sellers typically borrow from the holdings of institutions. Yet, institutional demand, and hence lending supply, is endogenous. This paper isolates changes in this demand due to investment mandates (benchmark indexes) to shed new light on the role of institutions in lending markets. In a model with benchmarked fund managers who supply their risky holdings for lending, the equilibrium price and lending supply are both higher for the benchmark asset. Larger supply alleviates short-selling constraints while higher shorting demand (due to inflated price) exacerbates them. Two quasi-natural experiments, the Russell index reconstitution and the Bank of Japan purchases, confirm that stocks with more institutional capital benchmarked against them have larger lending supply and demand. Ultimately, they are costlier to short. In both theory and data, results are driven by incomplete pass-through from institutional holdings to lending supply.

We document a rapid increase in retail trading in options in the U.S.  Facilitated by payment for order flow (PFOF) from wholesalers executing retail orders, retail trading recently reached over 60% of the total market volume. Nearly 90% of PFOF comes from three wholesalers. Exploiting new flags in transaction-level data, we isolate wholesaler trades and build a novel measure of retail options trading. Our measure comoves with equity-based retail activity proxies and drops significantly during U.S. brokerage platform outages and trading restrictions. Retail investors prefer cheaper, weekly options, with the average bid-ask spread of a whopping 12.6%, and lose money on average.

Benchmarking incentivizes fund managers to invest a fraction of their funds’ assets in their benchmark indices, and such demand is inelastic. We construct a measure of inelastic demand a stock attracts, benchmarking intensity (BMI), computed as its cumulative weight in all benchmarks, weighted by assets following each benchmark. Exploiting the Russell 1000/2000 cutoff, we show that changes in stocks’ BMIs instrument for changes in ownership of benchmarked investors. The resulting demand elasticities are low. We document that both active and passive fund managers buy additions to their benchmarks and sell deletions. Finally, an increase in BMI lowers future stock returns.

Bryzgalova and A. Pavlova). Revise & Resubmit in *<a style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">The Journal of Financial Economics</a>*. A part of this paper was previously circulated under the title "Profiting from Investor Mistakes: Evidence from Suboptimal Option Exercise."

We propose a model in which arbitrageurs act strategically in markets with entry costs. In a repeated game, arbitrageurs choose to specialize in some markets, which leads to the highest combined profits. We present  evidence consistent with our theory from the options market, in which suboptimally unexercised options create arbitrage opportunities for intermediaries. Using transaction-level data, we identify the corresponding arbitrage trades. Consistent with the model, only 57% of these opportunities attract entry by arbitrageurs.  Of those that do, 50% attract only one arbitrageur. Finally, our paper details how market participants circumvent a regulation devised to curtail this arbitrage strategy.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) depend on arbitrageurs to correct deviations between a fund's price and its fair value. ETFs have designated brokers, or authorized participants (APs), who have a unique right to create and redeem ETF shares, and who can thus trade on ETF mispricing without risk. Using novel regulatory filings, we provide the first description of the US ETF-AP network. It has a dense core and a sparse periphery, and the observed creation/redemption volumes are highly concentrated. The level of mispricing in a US equity ETF is negatively related to the fund's primary market diversity, especially during times of high market volatility. Funds that share more APs exhibit stronger mispricing comovement. We theoretically show that diverse primary markets help mitigate the effect of shocks to AP-specific arbitrage costs. We highlight the importance of AP balance sheet usage costs in ETF markets by exploiting the Federal Reserve's purchases of bond ETFs in 2020.
