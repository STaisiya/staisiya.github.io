Benchmarking incentivizes fund managers to invest a fraction of their funds’ assets in their benchmark indices, and such demand is inelastic. We construct a measure of inelastic demand a stock attracts, benchmarking intensity (BMI), computed as its cumulative weight in all benchmarks, weighted by assets following each benchmark. Exploiting the Russell 1000/2000 cutoff, we show that changes in stocks’ BMIs instrument for changes in ownership of benchmarked investors. The resulting demand elasticities are low. We document that both active and passive fund managers buy additions to their benchmarks and sell deletions. Finally, an increase in BMI lowers future stock returns.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) depend on arbitrageurs to correct deviations between a fund's price and its fair value. ETFs have designated brokers, or authorized participants (APs), who have a unique right to create and redeem ETF shares, and who can thus trade on ETF mispricing without risk. Using novel regulatory filings, we provide the first description of the US ETF-AP network. It has a dense core and a sparse periphery, and the observed creation/redemption volumes are highly concentrated. The level of mispricing in a US equity ETF is negatively related to the fund's network diversity, especially during times of high market volatility. Funds that share more APs exhibit stronger mispricing comovement. We theoretically show that diverse networks help mitigate the effect of shocks to AP-specific arbitrage costs. We highlight the importance of AP balance sheet usage costs in ETF markets by exploiting the Federal Reserve's purchases of bond ETFs in 2020.

This paper documents rapid increases in (i) retail investor trading in options and in (ii) payment for order flow (PFOF) for options transactions received by the U.S. retail brokerages. PFOF comes from so-called wholesalers/internalizers -- market makers who execute order flow for a retail brokerage. Exploiting new reporting requirements and transaction-level data, we isolate wholesaler trades and propose a novel measure of retail investor trading in options. We find that retail traders prefer cheaper, weekly options, the average quoted bid-ask spread for which is a whopping 12.3%, and lose money on aggregate. The inflow of retail investors also coincides with an increase in call options left suboptimally unexercised. Market makers (and other arbitrageurs) exploit these mistakes via the so-called "dividend play" trades, producing (virtually) riskless arbitrage profits. Puzzlingly, they forgo 50% of these profits, leaving money on the table for option writers. Our findings suggest that the arbitrageurs behave non-competitively and that the Big Three wholesalers, whose share in PFOF for options surpassed 85%, seem to benefit disproportionately from the growth in retail trading.
