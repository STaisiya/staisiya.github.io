Forthcoming in *<a style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">The Journal of Finance</a>*, solicited.

We document rapid increases in (i) retail trading in options and (ii) payment for order flow (PFOF), received by the U.S. retail brokerages from the so-called wholesalers in exchange for routing orders to them. Nearly 90% of PFOF comes from three wholesalers. Exploiting new flags in transaction-level data, we isolate wholesaler trades and build a novel measure of retail options trading. Our measure comoves with equity-based retail activity proxies and drops significantly during U.S. brokerage platform outages and trading restrictions. Retail investors prefer cheaper, weekly options, with the average bid-ask spread of a whopping 12.6%, and lose money on average.

Pavlova). *<a href="https://academic.oup.com/rfs/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rfs/hhac055/6665907" style="color: black;">The Review of Financial Studies, 36(3), 2023, pp. 859–903.</a>* Editor's Choice.

Benchmarking incentivizes fund managers to invest a fraction of their funds’ assets in their benchmark indices, and such demand is inelastic. We construct a measure of inelastic demand a stock attracts, benchmarking intensity (BMI), computed as its cumulative weight in all benchmarks, weighted by assets following each benchmark. Exploiting the Russell 1000/2000 cutoff, we show that changes in stocks’ BMIs instrument for changes in ownership of benchmarked investors. The resulting demand elasticities are low. We document that both active and passive fund managers buy additions to their benchmarks and sell deletions. Finally, an increase in BMI lowers future stock returns.

**<a href="" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">When Less is More: Effects of Benchmarking on Securities Lending</a>** 

Securities lending is a lucrative business for investment managers. Yet, what managers hold, and hence can lend, is dictated by their benchmark indexes. This paper explores how benchmarking affects equilibrium in the securities lending market. In a model with benchmarked fund managers who supply their risky holdings for lending, benchmarking affects both asset price and lending supply. Simple intuition suggests that a larger supply should alleviate short-selling constraints. However, my model shows that benchmarking may increase lending fees by attracting higher shorting demand. I test predictions of my model using two quasi-natural experiments, the Russell index reconstitution and the Bank of Japan purchases, in which there are exogenous shocks to how much capital is benchmarked against stocks. I find that, contrary to the intuition, it becomes costlier to short stocks whose benchmarking intensities increase. I use novel regulatory filings to suggest that lending limits are driving a wedge between the demand and supply effects of benchmarking.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) depend on arbitrageurs to correct deviations between a fund's price and its fair value. ETFs have designated brokers, or authorized participants (APs), who have a unique right to create and redeem ETF shares, and who can thus trade on ETF mispricing without risk. Using novel regulatory filings, we provide the first description of the US ETF-AP network. It has a dense core and a sparse periphery, and the observed creation/redemption volumes are highly concentrated. The level of mispricing in a US equity ETF is negatively related to the fund's primary market diversity, especially during times of high market volatility. Funds that share more APs exhibit stronger mispricing comovement. We theoretically show that diverse primary markets help mitigate the effect of shocks to AP-specific arbitrage costs. We highlight the importance of AP balance sheet usage costs in ETF markets by exploiting the Federal Reserve's purchases of bond ETFs in 2020.

The recent retail trading boom in the U.S. options market, driven by an inflow of inexperienced investors, coincides with an increase in call option contracts left suboptimally unexercised.  Arbitrageurs exploit these investor mistakes via so-called dividend play trades, which produce (virtually) riskless profits.  Using transaction-level data and a new reporting requirement, we identify dividend play trades and document rising profits from this strategy.  Puzzlingly, however, arbitrageurs leave 50% of potential profits on the table. Few arbitrageurs exploit each contract, with a median of only one. Finally, our paper details how market participants circumvent a regulation devised to curtail dividend play.
