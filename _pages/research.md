Benchmarking incentivizes fund managers to invest a fraction of their funds’ assets in their benchmark indices, and such demand is inelastic. We construct a measure of inelastic demand a stock attracts, benchmarking intensity (BMI), computed as its cumulative weight in all benchmarks, weighted by assets following each benchmark. Exploiting the Russell 1000/2000 cutoff, we show that changes in stocks’ BMIs instrument for changes in ownership of benchmarked investors. The resulting demand elasticities are low. We document that both active and passive fund managers buy additions to their benchmarks and sell deletions. Finally, an increase in BMI lowers future stock returns.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) depend on arbitrageurs to correct deviations between a fund's price and its fair value. ETFs have designated brokers, or authorized participants (APs), who have a unique right to create and redeem ETF shares, and who can thus trade on ETF mispricing without risk. Using novel regulatory filings, we provide the first description of the US ETF-AP network. It has a dense core and a sparse periphery, and the observed creation/redemption volumes are highly concentrated. The level of mispricing in a US equity ETF is negatively related to the fund's primary market diversity, especially during times of high market volatility. Funds that share more APs exhibit stronger mispricing comovement. We theoretically show that diverse primary markets help mitigate the effect of shocks to AP-specific arbitrage costs. We highlight the importance of AP balance sheet usage costs in ETF markets by exploiting the Federal Reserve's purchases of bond ETFs in 2020.

We document rapid increases in (i) retail trading in options and (ii) payment for order flow, received by the U.S. retail brokerages from the so-called wholesalers in exchange for routing orders to them. Exploiting new flags in transaction-level data, we isolate wholesaler trades and build a novel proxy for retail options trading. Often cash-constrained, retail investors prefer cheaper, lottery-like weekly options, with the average bid-ask spread of a whopping 12.6%. They lose money on average and participate in frenzies. The inflow of retail investors also coincides with an increase in call options left suboptimally unexercised. Arbitrageurs exploit these investor mistakes via so-called “dividend play” trades, producing (virtually) riskless arbitrage profits. Puzzlingly, they forgo 50% of these profits, leaving money on the table for option writers.
